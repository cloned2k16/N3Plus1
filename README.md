# N3Plus1 debunked  
( simple POC https://cloned2k16.github.io/N3Plus1/ )  

## It's really funny to see mathematicians lose their sleep with such a trivial problem ..  
as always,
mathematicians know an incredible number of tricks  to play with algebra 
while they still don't understand the actuall meaning of what they are doing .. 
so instead to understand the problem by looking from correct perspective 
they always adore like some kind of divine miracle things that escape from linear calculations ..

I just came across this some days ago, and still struggle to understand what's the mystery  
of such predictable chaotic function  
  
thing is ,,  
  
first of all isn't an actual function but, a permutation ..   
what's the difference ? well ..   

a cahotic/fuzzy function follow rules which is what make them different from 'linear' functions   
where there's no such thing as rules but only pure math ..  
  
we have cahotic/fuzzy functions that got rules while are still strictly math based     
then we have permutations, where rules aren't strictly math but based on digits/patterns  ( eg xor of bits is a permutation )  
so a rule based on odd/even is just a permutation enven if 'unpredictable' ..  
well, unpredictable, neither .. given it's a kind of cahotic function with a very stable attractor  
  
the main mistake of Math people is to consider it as a math function where you assing a vaule to x and get the result or list of result   
then even worse they try to figure out how to predict the path for any single input loosing completely the perspective ..  
  
 fact is .. this function just drives ( atract ) any infinite number of numbers ..   
 throug an unique path that always goes back to number 4 which is the actual root here,  
 2 and 1 just make it beauty having themselve as part of a loop once 4 is reached,   
 but actually don't make any difference in the nature of the permutation function itself so you can just leave the loop out for convenience  
 
 ## so what's really going on .. 
 
 well , the combination of base 10 numbers plus the odd even rules combined with the math n3+1 n1/2 
 does the trick of shaping a series of infinite spiral paths that comes from 'infinite' and goes thoward 4
 however they cycle over and over again (or not ) depending their starting point .. 
 eg 8 reach 4 imediately after just one step, while 27 does 111 steps before , however .. point is
 16 is one step away from 8 and share same path then .. as for 54 which is one step away from 27 
 and so then shares 111 exact same steps , while from his point of view are 112 and so on for 108 , 216 etc .. 
 
 all converge to same exact ending path , and this is the very point of this .. 
 no mistery no unpredictability .. after some loop ahead all numbers will just fall back 
 to some pre existing path which goes inevitabily down to 4 and mean while they will share several 
 parts of their path to many other (infinite) numbers ..   
 ## none never will escape   
 it's just a fractal progression which scales again and again
